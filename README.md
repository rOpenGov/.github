# Welcome to rOpengov-project!

rOpenGov is a community of R package developers on open government data analytics and related topics.

The open collaboration network was initiated in 2010 and has since then led to many R packages and other fruitful outcomes. A number of independent authors have contributed through github and written to the [rOpenGov blog](https://ropengov.org/post/).

You are welcome to check out our projects and join us. Proposals for new collaborations are also always welcome! See the [community page](https://ropengov.org/community/) for info on the people behind rOpenGov and get in touch.
